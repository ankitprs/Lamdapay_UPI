# Lamdapay - UPI Payments SDK (Open Source Project)

Lamdapay is an open-source project focused on developing an advanced UPI (Unified Payments Interface) Payments SDK. This SDK is designed to empower businesses and developers to seamlessly integrate UPI payment functionality into their applications. The project includes an Android SDK, a server-side SDK, and has future plans to introduce a web SDK.

## Features

- **Android SDK**: The Android SDK enables developers to easily integrate UPI payment functionalities into their Android applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including transaction initiation, payment status tracking, and seamless integration with popular UPI payment apps.

- **Server-side SDK**: The server-side SDK is a robust toolkit that allows businesses to handle UPI payment processing efficiently and securely. It supports essential functions such as generating payment links, verifying transaction statuses, and managing refunds. The server-side SDK streamlines payment workflows and enhances the overall user experience.

- **Future Plan: Web SDK**: The Lamdapay project has an exciting roadmap that includes the development of a web SDK. The upcoming web SDK will enable businesses to seamlessly integrate UPI payments into their web-based applications, expanding their customer base and offering payment convenience across platforms.

## Objective

One of the primary goals of Lamdapay is to reduce the transaction charges associated with UPI payments. By leveraging an open-source approach, Lamdapay aims to eliminate unnecessary intermediaries, enabling businesses and consumers to enjoy a lower transaction fee. The project is committed to reducing charges by up to 2%, making digital payments more affordable and accessible.
